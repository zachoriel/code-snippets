# Overview

Hi there! This is a centralized location for me to show code samples, primarily for the purposes of job applications. I also have four years worth of TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python code, but I can't show them as they're part of a proprietary codebase. However, I'm more than happy to discuss the work I've done in those stacks.

Thanks for checking out my code! ðŸ™‚

## Code Snippets â€” C#

### ðŸ“Œ `ArenaAllocator.Allocate` â€“ Manual Allocation with Alignment and Logging

This method manually allocates memory from a preallocated byte arena, honoring custom alignment requirements using bitwise math. It includes:

- **Power-of-two validation** to enforce safe alignment boundaries.
- **Offset alignment logic** using efficient bitmasking operations.
- **Overflow protection** with clear error logging if an allocation would exceed arena capacity.
- **Tracking** of alignment padding (i.e., wasted bytes to meet alignment constraints).
- **Structured telemetry** through centralized logging and custom allocation monitoring tools.

> *Skills demonstrated:* low-level memory management, bitwise arithmetic, runtime safety, diagnostic logging, and performance-aware systems design.

### ðŸ“Œ `ArenaUtil.GetNextPowerOfTwo` â€“ Fast Power-of-Two Round-Up Utility

This method efficiently computes the next power of two greater than or equal to a given value using bitwise operations. Itâ€™s particularly useful for calculating safe memory alignment sizes in custom allocators or performance-critical systems.

- **Bitwise rounding**: Uses shift-and-OR techniques to round up with minimal CPU overhead.
- **Clamping support**: Accepts an optional maximum value to avoid overshooting (defaults to 64).
- **Robust design**: Guarantees a minimum return value of 1, with safe handling of edge cases like non-positive input.

> *Skills demonstrated:* bit-level optimization, utility function design, numerical edge-case handling, and memory-alignment strategy.

### ðŸ“Œ `ArenaArray<T>` Constructor â€“ Type-Safe Unmanaged Array Allocation

This constructor allocates a fixed-size, unmanaged array from a custom memory arena, enforcing strict runtime guarantees on usage and safety:

- **Generic type constraint enforcement** using `UnsafeUtility.IsUnmanaged<T>()` ensures only unmanaged value types are accepted.
- **Fail-fast parameter checks** for invalid lengths or unsupported types.
- **Size and alignment calculation** based on the underlying type, using power-of-two rounding for alignment safety.
- **Hard allocation failure handling**, including clear exception messaging if the memory arena is exhausted.

> *Skills demonstrated:* generic programming with runtime validation, type safety in low-level memory contexts, robust constructor design, and defensive programming.

### ðŸ“Œ Benchmark Cycle Loop â€“ Allocation, GC Profiling, and Logging

This block is part of a larger function that benchmarks performance and memory usage of dynamically allocated buffers over multiple frames, with optional Burst compilation:

- **Controlled memory allocation** using custom unmanaged arrays (`ArenaArray<float>`) inside a deterministic loop.
- **Branching logic** for toggling Burst vs. non-Burst noise generation, testing performance deltas.
- **Garbage collection tracking** via `GC.CollectionCount()` before and after the operation.
- **Timing and telemetry** captured with `Time.realtimeSinceStartup` and stored in structured `BenchmarkRecord`s.
- **All data points**â€”timing, memory, GC pressureâ€”are appended to a log for later analysis/export.

> *Skills demonstrated:* performance instrumentation, real-time metrics tracking, Burst-aware conditional logic, and systems benchmarking.

### ðŸ“Œ `ArenaLog.Log` â€“ Custom Structured Logging with Severity and Formatting

A centralized logging method that formats debug output with color-coded severity, optional source tagging, and conditional logging controls:

- **Color-coded log levels** (Info, Warning, Error, Success) for easy scanning in Unityâ€™s console.
- **Dynamic prefix generation** based on the object type or name of the source emitter.
- **Formatted output** using inline rich text markup (e.g. `<color=#FF0000>`), tailored for Unityâ€™s log viewer.
- **Conditional activation** based on a runtime config flag (`EnableLogging`).
- **Persistent logging** via appending formatted messages to an internal output list for potential saving or reporting.

> *Skills demonstrated:* structured diagnostics, visual clarity in debug tooling, flexible logging system design, and runtime customization.

### ðŸ“Œ `ArenaMonitor.PrintSummary` â€“ Memory Diagnostics and Alignment Analysis

Generates a formatted summary of all recorded memory allocations across live arenas, including over-alignment statistics and optional tagging.

- **Allocation introspection**: Iterates over tracked arenas to compute per-instance over-alignment waste ratios.
- **Per-record breakdown**: Outputs details for each allocation, including offset, size, alignment, and optional tags.
- **Memory efficiency analysis**: Reports percentage of arena capacity lost to alignment padding, enabling tuning of allocator behavior.
- **Human-readable formatting**: Produces a structured summary string for logging or export.

> *Skills demonstrated:* runtime analytics, memory instrumentation, log formatting, and tooling to support performance-critical systems.
